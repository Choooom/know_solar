<p align="justify">The current world population is <b>7.9 billion</b> and for the source of energy most of us use <b>fossil fuel, coal, natural gas, water, oil, nuclear</b>. But every single source has it's own bad effect which is created impact on nature. When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we don't just meet our energy needs, we drive the current global warming crisis as well. Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change.

What if instead we got all of our energy from the sun. You may not know, but the Earth intercepts a lot of solar power a <b>Hundred and 73 thousand Tera watts</b>. That's <b>ten thousand</b> times more power than the planet's population uses.

So, Solar power could be the natural fit for this fuel problem. Solar power plants this may seem like an odd idea. But it's really been picking up steam in the last few years or so. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.

Unfortunately, though solar energy itself is free, the high cost of its collection, conversion, and storage still limits its exploitation in many places that is the problem we are trying to solve.</p>

<p align="justify">Know Solar offer an interactive user friendly Mobile application which explains the working method of solar panels, how we can collect and preserve electricity from solar power and reuse it properly and efficiently. We also want to promote the importance of solar power and its proper usage to general people by creating a community. We will motivate and consult them to use solar energy. To help this process we will contact with renowned solar panel companies, So that they can provide better service with solar panel usage and its financial benefits.</p>

<p align="justify">We can calculate the production, usage and reservation of solar power. With the help of NASA's solar and meteorological analysis data, such as geographical location, wind speed, humidity, rain, sunlight and hour forecast, we can monitor the possible solar power production.</p>

<p align="justify">In the future, we will integrate artificial intelligence-enabled hardware that can accurately estimate the power consumption of every single electronic device in your house. It will also estimate how much battery and solar panels you will need for a certain amount of the electronic device. We will also add an assistant for the app which will notify you if something wrong with your solar panel.</p>
